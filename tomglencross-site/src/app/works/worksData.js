        body: "the significance of THE OLD STONES is deeply communal, sensual, and unknowable. The rock carvings are pregnant with guesswork and invocations of thousands of years of living people, and the engraved marks are immortal imprints of their hands, their touch. Showing non-figurative abstract lines, organic circles, and their distinctive cup-and-ring marks, they were carved by people who saw little distinction between human-made and natural-made. The unadorned stones themselves may have held supernatural significance, deposited by glaciers millennia before even the hunter-gatherers, appearing as if from nowhere on the high crest of a miles-wide trough shaped valley – what power carried them up here to these vistas, and for what purpose? Tom’s medium format photographs, enlarged to dream-like proportions, continue to ask these questions and to celebrate these original records, the primary utterances and expressions of the earliest people, their society, their thoughts, their feelings."},

        body: "Departing from Scunthorpe Correspondences, a dialogue between Stoney and Tom Glencross, a UK-based writer and friend, that was conceived and published in the given framework, this exhibition is set alongside the struggles of the working-class in Scunthorpe, where both authors grew up. Once a symbol for prosperity and wealth, the town in northern England now faces widespread precarity and disenchantment due to the decline of the steel industry and deregulating, globalizing processes. This conversation interrelates Stoney’s family’s trajectory with larger colonial histories of the UK and the Partition of Pakistan and India in 1947.Details of the town of Scunthorpe are visualized in the exhibition through a selection of Glencross’ black-and-white photographs (Sensual objects, real qualities), reminiscent of the social realism of New Objectivity, such as Bernd and Hilla Becher’s portrayal of decommissioned industrial buildings and workers’ homes prior to their vanishing."},

        body: "For the Kyiv Biennial 2023, Miriam Stoney invites writer, photographer and childhood friend Tom Glencross to join her for a reading inside the installation The Most Humane. Drawing on themes inherent to this work, including the politics of witnessing and obfuscation, as well as the uses of ethical standards in encounters of radical alterity, Glencross and Stoney have written a new text that reflects on experiences of violence in everyday life and their responses to them – from the immediate, bodily reaction to the more distanced account in and through writing."},
